# ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ REACT - REACT UI ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Starter Kit + Useful Links

A React boilerplate with and based on:
  - React-scripts
  - Styled components
  - React-router
  - Lerna config
  - Storybook
  - Babel + Webpack custom config
  - ESLINT + airbnb rules
  - React Bootstrap (you may prefer reactstrap, it's more or less the same)
  - Customize-cra
  - React-app-rewired
  - Ant design
  
  ... and more and more
  
  Long story short, a powerful and scalable set of plugins ready-to-use that will allow you to start a project from scratch with everything you may need ( well... ðŸ˜‡).
  
  Lerna is already set up to manage, build and run the storybook/UI Library pack along with the app package.
  You have just to create the UI component inside the ui-pkg and then include it in the app-pgk like this:

  ```tsx
// in app-pgk containers/components  
import { MyUIComponent } from 'ui-pkg';
```
   
   It contains also different ways to handle styling in react, like   
   - `CSS-in-JS` --> `Styled Components`
   - `CSS modules`
   - native inline `style={{}}` 
   
In the next future i'll provide the same boilerplate with Redux Thunk and Saga as well, as of now there is only the middleware wrapping the App but not the actions/sagas/reducers templates 

## The steps you need to follow to install and run the project:

- from the root, run `npm install`
- from the root, run `npm run bootstrap-hoist`
- from the root, run `npm run ui-pkg-build`
- and then, to start the app-pkg run the command `npm run app-pkg-start`
- to see storybook, run the command `npm run ui-pkg-storybook-start`
